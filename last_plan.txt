### 3. VARIETY CHECK
Since this is our first formal plan together, I have curated a "Global Keto" palette. We are moving away from "plain chicken and broccoli" and introducing Mediterranean fats, Asian-inspired stir-fry, and French-style butter sauces to ensure palate fatigue never sets in.

### 5. THE RECIPES

#### **The Essential Keto Cloud Bread (Makes 6-8 pieces)**
*   **Ingredients:** 3 eggs (separated), 3 tbsp cream cheese (softened), 1/8 tsp cream of tartar, pinch of sea salt.
*   **Method:** Whisk egg whites and cream of tartar until stiff peaks form. In a separate bowl, blend egg yolks, cream cheese, and salt until smooth. 
*   **The Fold:** Gently fold the yolk mixture into the whites (don't deflate them!). 
*   **Bake:** Scoop onto a lined tray and bake at 150°C for 25-30 mins until golden. These are your "bread" for the bacon and eggs!

#### **Mon: Creamy Garlic Chicken & Spinach (Other/Chicken)**
Sear skin-on chicken thighs in butter until crispy. Remove chicken, then in the same pan, sauté minced garlic and two large handfuls of spinach until wilted. Stir in a splash of heavy cream or extra butter to create a rich sauce. Return chicken to the pan to coat. Serve with steamed broccoli.

#### **Tue: Beef & Cauliflower "Fried Rice" (Red Meat)**
Pulse cauliflower in a blender until it resembles rice. Brown the beef mince with ginger, garlic, and a splash of tamari (or salt). Toss in the cauliflower rice and sauté until tender. Finish with a drizzle of sesame oil and a fried egg on top for Jennifer.

#### **Wed: Lemon-Butter Salmon with Asparagus (Fish)**
Season salmon fillets with gray sea salt and pan-fry in coconut oil for 4 mins per side. In the final 3 mins, add a bunch of asparagus to the pan. Squeeze half a lemon over everything and top with a generous knob of grass-fed butter. High fat, high flavor, zero bloat.

#### **Thu: Mediterranean Turkey/Tofu Skillet (Other)**
Sauté ground turkey (or crumbled tofu) with dried oregano, olives, and diced zucchini. Cook until the zucchini is slightly caramelized. Serve in a bowl topped with a dollop of high-fat Greek yogurt or extra avocado. This is a light but nutrient-dense alkaline-leaning meal.

#### **Fri: Pan-Seared Barramundi with Pesto Zoodles (Fish)**
Use a spiralizer or peeler to make zucchini noodles. Flash-fry them in olive oil for only 2 mins (don't let them get soggy!). Top with a high-quality pesto. Sear the barramundi fillets separately until the skin is "cracker-crunchy" and place atop the green noodles.

#### **Sat: Chimichurri Steak with Green Beans (Red Meat)**
Grill your steak to your liking (Pascal, aim for medium-rare to preserve nutrients). Blend parsley, garlic, vinegar, and plenty of olive oil for a fresh chimichurri sauce. Serve with green beans sautéed in the steak juices. This provides the "Red Meat" requirement with an acidic/alkaline balance from the herbs.

#### **Sun: One-Pan Chicken & Mushroom Bake (Other/Chicken)**
Place chicken thighs and sliced mushrooms on a baking tray. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with thyme and gray sea salt. Bake at 200°C for 30 mins. The mushrooms soak up the chicken fat, creating a "flavor bomb" that keeps you full during your Sunday fast.

### 6. CLOSING
**Pascal:** Remember the **Dr. Boz Ratio** (Glucose mg/dL ÷ Ketones mmol/L). Aiming for under 20 is the "Holy Grail" for weight loss and mental clarity. Check your numbers after your Z2 cardio on Wednesday!

**Jennifer:** I’d love to hear more about your **"Best Self" vision**. Are we looking for more energy for creative projects, better sleep, or just feeling like a rockstar in your favorite outfit? Let me know so I can tweak your "flexible" portions!

To a week of victory and vibrant health!
