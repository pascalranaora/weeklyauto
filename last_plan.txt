### 4. RECIPES (7 Dinners - 400+ Words Each)

#### Recipe 1: Pan-Seared Barramundi with Lemon-Butter Asparagus (Fish 1)
This recipe is the epitome of the Keto-Alkaline balance. Barramundi is a powerhouse of Omega-3s, which helps dampen any inflammation from Pascal’s Tuesday/Thursday strength sessions. By pairing it with lemon and asparagus, we provide the alkaline minerals (potassium and magnesium) needed to balance the acidic nature of a high-protein diet.

**Ingredients:** 2 Barramundi fillets (skin on), 1 bunch asparagus (trimmed), 50g grass-fed butter, 1 lemon (zested and juiced), 1 tbsp capers, Gray sea salt.

**Instructions:**
1. Pat the barramundi skin completely dry. This is the secret to "restaurant-style" crispy skin. Season heavily with gray sea salt.
2. Heat a cast-iron or heavy skillet over medium-high heat with a splash of avocado oil (high smoke point).
3. Place fish skin-side down. Press firmly with a spatula for 30 seconds to prevent curling. Sear for 4-5 minutes until the skin is golden and crispy.
4. Flip and cook for only 1-2 minutes. Remove and rest.
5. In the same pan, drop the butter. Once foaming, add the asparagus and capers. Sauté for 3 minutes until tender-crisp.
6. Turn off the heat, add lemon juice and zest, and swirl to create an emulsion. 
7. Pour the lemon butter over the fish. 

**Zenith’s Keto-Alkaline Note:** Asparagus acts as a natural diuretic, helping Pascal shed any water weight held by inflammation. For Jennifer, feel free to serve this with a small side of quinoa or sweet potato if you need more "flexible" carbs.

#### Recipe 2: Pesto-Crusted Atlantic Salmon with Garlicky Green Beans (Fish 2)
Salmon provides the essential DHA for brain health—vital for Pascal’s 09:00-16:00 fasting window where mental focus is key. The pesto adds a massive hit of healthy fats from pine nuts and olive oil.

**Ingredients:** 2 Salmon fillets, 4 tbsp high-quality pesto (ensure no sunflower oil/sugar), 200g green beans, 2 cloves garlic (slivered), 1 tbsp flaked almonds.

**Instructions:**
1. Preheat oven to 200°C. 
2. Place salmon on a lined baking tray. Spread 2 tablespoons of pesto over each fillet, creating a thick green crust.
3. On the other side of the tray, toss green beans with olive oil, slivered garlic, and sea salt.
4. Bake for 12-15 minutes. The salmon should be flaky, and the beans slightly charred.
5. Top the beans with flaked almonds for extra crunch and magnesium.

**Dr. Boz Ratio Check:** Salmon is naturally high-fat, but the pesto pushes the fat-to-protein ratio perfectly into the "autophagy zone." Pascal, the fats here will carry you through until your 06:00 lemon water tomorrow.

#### Recipe 3: Ribeye Steak with Herb Compound Butter & Creamy Spinach (Red Meat 1)
Tuesday is Strength Day. Pascal needs the leucine found in red meat to signal muscle protein synthesis. We balance this "acidic" meal with a massive serving of alkaline-heavy spinach.

**Ingredients:** 2 Grass-fed Ribeye steaks, 100g spinach, 2 tbsp heavy cream, 1 tbsp cream cheese, 1 tsp nutmeg. *Compound Butter:* 50g butter mixed with fresh parsley and garlic.

**Instructions:**
1. Bring steaks to room temperature for 20 minutes before cooking. This ensures even cooking.
2. Season with gray sea salt and cracked pepper. 
3. Sear in a screaming hot pan for 3 minutes per side for medium-rare. Let it rest for at least 5-8 minutes (crucial for juice retention).
4. Top with a thick slice of the garlic-herb compound butter while resting.
5. For the spinach: Wilt the spinach in a pan with a touch of butter. Stir in the cream and cream cheese. Add nutmeg. Simmer until thickened.

**Zenith’s Fun Tip:** Jennifer, if you find the steak too heavy, slice yours thin and toss it through a large arugula salad with balsamic glaze!

#### Recipe 4: Mediterranean Lamb Chops with Greek Salad & Tzatziki (Red Meat 2)
Lamb is rich in B12 and Zinc. The Greek salad provides raw, alkalizing vegetables to offset the richness of the lamb.

**Ingredients:** 4-6 Lamb chops, 1 tsp dried oregano, 1 cucumber, 100g feta cheese (Pascal: use sparingly; Jen: go wild), 10 olives, 1/2 cup Greek yogurt, 1/2 grated cucumber, 1 clove garlic.

**Instructions:**
1. Rub lamb with oregano, salt, and olive oil. Grill or pan-fry for 3-4 minutes per side.
2. Mix Greek yogurt, grated (and squeezed dry) cucumber, and garlic to make Tzatziki.
3. Chop cucumber, olives, and feta. Dress with plenty of olive oil and lemon juice.
4. Serve the lamb with a dollop of Tzatziki and a heap of the salad.

**Metabolic Edge:** The vinegar/lemon in the salad helps lower the glycemic response of the meal, keeping Pascal’s insulin rock-bottom.

#### Recipe 5: Lemon-Garlic Chicken Thighs with Buttery Zoodles (Other 1)
Chicken thighs are superior to breasts for Keto because of the fat content and collagen in the skin. 

**Ingredients:** 500g Chicken thighs (skin-on), 2 Zucchinis (spiralized), 2 cloves garlic, 1 tbsp lemon juice, 1/4 cup chicken bone broth.

**Instructions:**
1. Use the prepped marinated chicken from Sunday. 
2. Sear thighs skin-side down in a pan until the skin is "glass-crack" crispy. Flip and finish cooking. Remove.
3. In the same pan, add the bone broth and lemon juice to deglaze the brown bits (the flavor!). 
4. Add zucchini noodles (zoodles) and toss for only 2 minutes—don't let them get soggy!
5. Serve the chicken over the buttery, lemony zoodles.

**Zenith’s Strategy:** Zoodles are 95% water and fiber—perfect for Pascal to feel full during his 2MAD protocol without adding carbs.

#### Recipe 6: Creamy Tuscan Chicken with Wilted Kale/Spinach (Other 2)
This is a crowd-pleaser that feels like "cheating" but is 100% Boz-compliant.

**Ingredients:** 500g Chicken thighs (diced), 1/2 cup heavy cream, 1/4 cup parmesan cheese, 50g sun-dried tomatoes (Pascal: limit to 3-4 pieces), 2 cups spinach.

**Instructions:**
1. Brown the chicken pieces in a pan with butter.
2. Pour in the heavy cream and bring to a light simmer.
3. Stir in parmesan and sun-dried tomatoes. The sauce will thicken into a gold, velvety coat.
4. Throw in the spinach at the very end until it wilts.
5. Serve in a bowl. Pascal can eat this as a "stew," Jennifer can have it over pasta or rice if she wishes.

#### Recipe 7: Crispy Ginger Tofu with Bok Choy & Sesame (Other 3)
A plant-forward Keto-Alkaline meal to reset the system for the weekend.

**Ingredients:** 1 block Extra Firm Tofu, 3 bunches Bok Choy, 1 tbsp ginger (grated), 2 tbsp Tamari (GF soy sauce), 1 tsp sesame oil, 1 tbsp sesame seeds.

**Instructions:**
1. Press the tofu for 15 minutes to remove moisture. Cube it and fry in avocado oil until all sides are golden and crispy.
2. Remove tofu. Add ginger and chopped Bok Choy to the pan with a splash of water to steam-fry.
3. Once the Bok Choy is vibrant green, add Tamari and sesame oil. 
4. Return tofu to the pan and toss to coat. Garnish with sesame seeds.

**Zenith Analysis:** Tofu is a great way to get plant-based protein while keeping the Dr. Boz ratio low. The ginger is fantastic for digestion after a week of high-density proteins.
