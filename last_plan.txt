### 6. RECIPES (Keto-Alkaline Focused)

#### RECIPE 1: Pan-Seared Barramundi with Lemon-Caper Butter & Asparagus (Fish 1)
**The Science of the Dish:** 
This recipe is a masterpiece of the Keto-Alkaline philosophy. Barramundi is an incredible source of Omega-3 fatty acids, which are essential for reducing systemic inflammation—a key hurdle in Pascal’s 5-month reset. By using skin-on fillets, we ensure Pascal gets those healthy fats that keep the Dr. Boz ratio low. The addition of lemon and asparagus provides the "Alkaline" counter-balance. While the fish provides an acidic load (typical of proteins), the high potassium and magnesium content in the asparagus, combined with the citric acid from the lemon (which has an alkalizing effect once metabolized), keeps the pH balanced.

**Ingredients:**
*   2 Barramundi Fillets (Skin on)
*   2 Bunches of Asparagus
*   50g Grass-fed Butter
*   2 tbsp Capers (drained)
*   1 Lemon (Juice and zest)
*   2 tbsp Olive oil
*   Gray Sea Salt & Cracked Pepper

**Instructions:**
1.  **Pat it Dry:** This is the Zenith secret to crispy skin. Use a paper towel to dry the fish skin completely. Season only the flesh side with salt and pepper.
2.  **The Sear:** Heat olive oil in a pan over medium-high heat. Place the fish skin-side down. Press down firmly for 30 seconds to ensure even contact. Cook for 4-5 minutes until the skin is golden and crispy.
3.  **The Flip:** Turn the fish over gently and cook for another 2 minutes. Remove the fish and let it rest on a warm plate.
4.  **The Sauce:** In the same pan, turn heat to low and add the butter. Once bubbling, toss in the capers and lemon zest. Let them sizzle for 1 minute until the butter smells nutty. Stir in the lemon juice.
5.  **The Veg:** Steam the asparagus for 3 minutes until tender-crisp. 
6.  **Assembly:** Plate the asparagus, place the fish on top (skin up to stay crispy!), and drizzle the lemon-caper butter generously over the fish and greens.
*   **Zenith Fun Tip:** If you hear the skin "crack" when you bite into it, you’ve done it right! That sound is the melody of successful keto cooking.

#### RECIPE 2: Slow-Braised Beef Cheek with Garlic-Cauliflower Mash (Red Meat 1)
**The Science of the Dish:** 
Beef cheeks are a "Zenith Favorite" because they are incredibly rich in collagen and connective tissue. As Pascal loses weight, collagen supports skin elasticity and joint health. This dish is intentionally high-fat and moderate-protein, making it perfect for hitting a Dr. Boz ratio of <20. The cauliflower mash serves as a low-carb vehicle for the braising liquid, providing fiber to support the gut microbiome—often neglected in "dirty" keto diets.

**Ingredients:**
*   1kg Beef Cheek or Chuck Steak (cubed)
*   1 Large Cauliflower
*   2 cups Beef Bone Broth
*   1 Onion (finely diced - for flavor, don't eat too much of it, Pascal!)
*   4 Cloves Garlic (minced)
*   2 tbsp Tomato Paste (check for no added sugar)
*   100g Butter (split between beef and mash)
*   Fresh Rosemary and Thyme

**Instructions:**
1.  **The Browning:** Season beef with Gray Sea Salt. In a heavy pot (or your Sunday prep pot), sear the beef in butter until browned on all sides. This creates the Maillard reaction, giving us deep flavor without sugar.
2.  **The Braise:** Add garlic, rosemary, thyme, and tomato paste. Stir for 60 seconds. Pour in the bone broth. Cover and simmer on very low for 3-4 hours, or use a slow cooker on low for 8 hours. The meat should fall apart with a spoon.
3.  **The Mash:** While the beef rests, chop the cauliflower into florets and steam until very soft. 
4.  **The Emulsion:** Place the steamed cauliflower in a blender with the remaining butter, salt, and a splash of the beef braising liquid. Blitz until it reaches a "silk-like" consistency.
5.  **Serving:** Create a "pillow" of cauliflower mash in a bowl. Top with a generous portion of the tender beef and a ladle of the reduced cooking juices.
*   **Zenith Fun Tip:** Beef cheeks are the "set and forget" champions. While this cooks, Pascal, you should be doing your Z2 Cardio or having that cold shower!

#### RECIPE 3: Thai Green Chicken Curry with Zucchini Noodles (Other 1)
**The Science of the Dish:** 
This dish focuses on MCTs (Medium Chain Triglycerides) from the coconut milk, which are converted directly into ketones by the liver. The inclusion of ginger and turmeric (found in green curry paste) acts as a powerful anti-inflammatory. By replacing rice with Zucchini Noodles (Zoodles), we keep the net carbs near zero while adding much-needed volume and hydration.

**Ingredients:**
*   600g Chicken Thighs (sliced)
*   2 Cans Full-fat Coconut Milk
*   3 tbsp Thai Green Curry Paste (Ensure no sugar/cornstarch)
*   2 Large Zucchinis (spiralized)
*   1 Red Bell Pepper (thinly sliced)
*   1 tbsp Fish Sauce
*   Fresh Cilantro and Lime wedges

**Instructions:**
1.  **The Coconut "Crack":** Open the cans of coconut milk. Scoop the thick cream from the top into a wok or large pan. Cook over medium heat until it starts to bubble and separate (the oil will "crack" from the solids).
2.  **The Spice:** Add the curry paste to the coconut oil/cream and fry for 2 minutes until fragrant.
3.  **The Protein:** Add the chicken thighs and stir to coat in the paste. Cook for 5 minutes.
4.  **The Simmer:** Pour in the rest of the coconut milk and the fish sauce. Simmer for 10-12 minutes until the chicken is cooked through. Add the bell peppers for the last 3 minutes so they stay crunchy.
5.  **The Zoodles:** Use a spiralizer on the zucchinis. Do not cook them in the sauce! Place raw zoodles in the serving bowl and pour the hot curry over them. The residual heat will soften them perfectly without making them watery.
6.  **Garnish:** Top with a mountain of cilantro and a squeeze of lime.
*   **Zenith Fun Tip:** This dish is even better the next day, making it a perfect lunch for Jennifer if there are leftovers!

#### RECIPE 4: Grilled Salmon with Pesto & Walnut-Kale Salad (Fish 2)
**The Science of the Dish:** 
Salmon provides the DHA/EPA fats required for cognitive function during a calorie deficit. We’re pairing this with a kale salad. Kale is one of the most alkaline-forming foods on the planet, helping to neutralize any metabolic acidity from Pascal's high-intensity training. The walnuts add a different texture and a secondary source of ALA (Alpha-Linolenic Acid).

**Ingredients:**
*   2 Salmon Fillets
*   4 tbsp Basil Pesto (check label for sunflower oil—try to find olive oil-based)
*   1 Bunch Kale (stems removed, finely shredded)
*   1/2 cup Walnuts (toasted)
*   2 tbsp Apple Cider Vinegar (Alkaline support)
*   1/4 cup Olive Oil

**Instructions:**
1.  **Massage the Kale:** This is crucial! Put the shredded kale in a bowl with a pinch of salt and 1 tsp of olive oil. Use your hands to "massage" it for 2 minutes until it turns dark green and soft. This breaks down the cellulose, making it easier to digest.
2.  **The Dressing:** Whisk the ACV and olive oil. Toss with the kale and toasted walnuts.
3.  **The Salmon:** Grill the salmon on a medium heat for 3-4 minutes per side. 
4.  **The Topping:** Once the salmon is off the heat, spread 2 tablespoons of pesto over each fillet. The heat from the fish will melt the pesto into a delicious glaze.
5.  **Serving:** Serve the salmon alongside the large, nutty kale salad.
*   **Zenith Fun Tip:** Jennifer, feel free to add some berries or a small portion of quinoa to your salad if you want those "flexible" carbs!
